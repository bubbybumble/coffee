# coffee
The *real* java script

this is a work in progress

inspired by [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai) (but considerably less advanced)

## What is it
This makes it so your terminal has an animated cup of coffee. It is my theory that it is not the coffee that makes me more productive, but rather having a coffee on my desk that does. This fulfills that functionality without having to brew a real cup.
